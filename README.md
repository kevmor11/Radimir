# Radimir - WORK IN PROGRESS

Web application I am designing for Graphic Designers and visual artists to use as a platform for displaying their portfolio and uploading new work.

## Features
- Dynamically generated galleries of images.
- Admin user can log onto a private backend and upload new content.
- Optimized for Desktop or Mobile

## Technologies
Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, jQuery

## Setup
Clone this repo to your desktop and from repository root directory run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

---

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run  `npm start` from the root directory to start the application.

You will then be able to view the web app at either:

localhost:3000

OR

https://radimir-portfolio.herokuapp.com/
